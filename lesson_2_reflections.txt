What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	a .git metadata directory is created so that changes can be tracked by git

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	Working directory containes all files that are currently in the directory but may
	not be tracked. Staging area, however, containes files that will be part of the next
	commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	Staging area can be used to pick from working directory and add only the files modfied
	to produce a logical change to the code.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

	Branches are useful when adding new features or testing new ideas. These changes will not affect main code
	and will keep things organized. Branches can later be merged to include the new code in other branches

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	Diagrams help us visualize the branch structures by showing the parent of each commit,
	and therefore, the reachability of a commit.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

	A new commit is created that combines the changes in both branches. The new commit keeps information
	about merged branches as parents and will be connected to both.
