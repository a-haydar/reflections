What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	a .git metadata directory is created so that changes can be tracked by git

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	Working directory containes all files that are currently in the directory but may
	not be tracked. Staging area, however, containes files that will be part of the next
	commit.
