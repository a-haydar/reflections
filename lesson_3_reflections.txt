When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	when working with others
	also as a backup

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Same to the idea of automatic commits vs manual, I need to control when I pull changes
	as well as what changes to pull so that I can merge when I need where I need
