When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	when working with others
	also as a backup

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Same to the idea of automatic commits vs manual, I need to control when I pull changes
	as well as what changes to pull so that I can merge when I need where I need 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	forks are clones of peoples' repositories on github that are used to modify someone's code while
	giving credit and keeping his/her code untouched

	clones are copies of a repository without additional information attached and are normally used to clone
	a remote repository to work on locally

	branches are a way to group and label commits to logical units of work in order to keep work organized.
